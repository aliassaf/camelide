Camelide is an interpreter for Dedukti, written for OCaml.

The source code is available on GitHub at:
https://github.com/aliassaf/camelide

You need OCaml to compile it. It was tested with OCaml 3.12.0, but previous
versions should work just as well. To compile, simply run make in the source
directory. It will produce an executable named 'camelide'.

Usage: ./camelide <options> <file>
  -v <level> Set verbosity level
  -help      Display this list of options
  --help     Display this list of options
