Camelide is an interpreter for Dedukti, written for OCaml.

The source code is available on GitHub at:
https://github.com/aliassaf/camelide

You need OCaml to compile it. It was tested with OCaml 3.12.0, but previous
versions should probably work too. To compile, simple run make in the source
directory. It will produce an executable named 'camelide'.

  ./camelide --help

for a usage description.
